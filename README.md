# FooterScrollViewDemo

This project demonstrates showing and hiding a bottom footer upon tap.

Auto layout is used to keep the footer of a fixed height with a fixed header for the title and with a scroll view to cater for the entire content dynamically. 

The scroll view also only bounces in one direction i.e when scrolling up.
